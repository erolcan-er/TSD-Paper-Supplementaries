----Instruction----
In the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB), discourse relations are typically defined between two segments of text called arguments: Arg-1 and Arg-2.
These arguments can be abstract objects such as Assertion Proposition, Belief Proposition, Eventualities, or Facts.
Discourse relations are categorized within a hierarchical sense inventory.
These senses provide a detailed classification of discourse relations.
We wanted to determine the sense of our discourse relation.

----Definitions----
- Comparison: This relation is used when two discourse units are examined in relation to one another. It may highlight similarities (showing equivalence or resemblance), differences (emphasizing contrasts), or even acknowledge that an expected connection (such as a causal link) does not hold (as in concessions).
- Contingency:This relation connects propositions by showing that one situation is dependent on or follows from another. It includes straightforward cause–effect links (where one event brings about another), evidential connections that encourage a belief, and purpose relations where an action is undertaken to achieve a specific goal.
- Expansion: This relation serves to add extra information or elaborate on a situation without implying a direct causal or temporal connection. It might introduce additional details, offer alternative perspectives on the same event (or situation), or specify instances or levels of detail that further flesh out the original idea.
- Temporal: This relation situates events in time. It indicates whether events occur simultaneously (with some temporal overlap) or sequentially (with one event clearly preceding another), thereby establishing the time-based structure of the narrative or discourse.

----Demonstrations----
Arg-1: I used magnetic resonance imaging to capture the actual shape of the patient's anatomy
Arg-2: then use finite element modeling to better predict the internal stresses and strains on the normal forces
Answer: The use of “then” signals a sequential order where the first event (capturing the anatomy) happens before the second event (modeling for prediction). This ordering—one event following the other in time—fits the definition of a Temporal relation.
//
Arg-1: I stood and watched
Arg-2: as the coach drove up these women in this gray van
Answer: The connector “as” indicates that both events occur concurrently. The act of standing and watching happens at the same time as the coach’s arrival, demonstrating temporal overlap, which is characteristic of a Temporal relation.
//
Arg-1: I like it
Arg-2: because it pokes fun at both sides of the climate change issue
Answer: Here, Arg-2 provides the causal explanation for the feeling expressed in Arg-1. The word “because” directly links liking the subject to the reason it is appreciated. This fits the Contingency label, where one event or claim is causally influenced by the other.
//
Arg-1: it's reckless to ignore these things
Arg-2: doing so can jeopardize future long-term returns
Answer: In this case, Arg-2 offers not only a causal effect (jeopardizing returns) but also serves as evidence to support the claim in Arg-1, encouraging the hearer to believe that ignoring the issues is indeed reckless. This extra persuasive, belief-inducing component justifies the Contingency label.
//
Arg-1: you have to aim at something slightly skew from it
Arg-2: in order that to actually hit your target
Answer: Arg-2 clearly states the purpose behind the action described in Arg-1. The phrase “in order that” indicates that aiming off-center is done with the goal (or purpose) of successfully hitting the target. Thus, the relation is Contingency.
//
Arg-1: Success motivates us
Arg-2: but a near win can propel us in an ongoing quest
Answer: The use of “but” highlights a contrast between the effects of success versus a near win. Even though both statements deal with motivation, they emphasize different kinds of outcomes, thereby contrasting two related yet distinct phenomena. The sense is Comparison.
//
Arg-1: That's 133 trillion combined
Arg-2: That's eight and a half times the GDP of the U.S
Answer: Although each argument states a different numerical fact, Arg-2 is used to interpret or frame the magnitude mentioned in Arg-1. They both serve to illustrate the enormity of a quantity, highlighting a similarity or equivalence between the two perspectives. The sense is Comparison.
//
Arg-1: these things are fundamental
Arg-2: but they're not enough
Answer: The second statement introduces a caveat to the first by conceding that, while the things in question are fundamental, they fall short of sufficiency. The “but” marks a cancellation of the expected positive evaluation, making it a concession. The sense is Comparison.
//
Arg-1: They're economic issues
Arg-2: and that makes them relevant to risk and return
Answer: Here, both arguments are connected in a way that they each contribute to a broader point. Arg-1 categorizes the issues, and Arg-2 links that category to a further concept (risk and return). The conjunction “and” shows that each argument independently relates to the same larger context. The sense is Expansion.
//
Arg-1: Many cities are investing in green infrastructure to combat climate change
Arg-2: New York City has implemented a large-scale tree-planting initiative to reduce urban heat and improve air quality
Answer: Arg-1 provides a general statement about a trend across cities. Arg-2 then offers a specific example (instantiation) of that trend by citing New York City’s initiative. This is a classic case of instantiation where the specific example illustrates the broader phenomenon. The sense is Expansion.
//
Arg-1: Let me remind you what we already know
Arg-2: We have a population that's both growing and aging
Answer: Arg-1 signals a reminder or summary, while Arg-2 provides the details that flesh out that reminder. The relation here is about elaborating on a known fact by adding more detail, which corresponds to Expansion.
//
Arg-1: prudent investing and finance theory aren't subordinate to sustainability
Arg-2: They're compatible
Answer: The second argument reframes or substitutes the idea presented in the first. Instead of accepting a hierarchical relationship (subordination), it proposes an alternative view—that the two are compatible. This substitution of perspective justifies the label Expansion.
//
Arg-1: That's the world's largest economy
Arg-2: That's some serious freaking firepower
Answer: Although expressed differently, both arguments refer to the same entity and emphasize its magnitude. Arg-1 states it as a fact (largest economy), while Arg-2 offers a qualitative interpretation (serious firepower). They are equivalent in describing the same situation from different angles, hence the label Expansion.
