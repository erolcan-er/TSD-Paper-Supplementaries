----Instruction----
In the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB), discourse relations are typically defined between two segments of text called arguments: Arg-1 and Arg-2.
These arguments can be abstract objects such as Assertion Proposition, Belief Proposition, Eventualities, or Facts.
Discourse relations are categorized within a hierarchical sense inventory.
These senses provide a detailed classification of discourse relations.
We wanted to determine the sense of our discourse relation.

----Definitions----
- Concession: An expected causal relation is canceled or denied by the situation described in one of the arguments.
- Contrast: At least two differences between the arguments are highlighted.
- Similarity: Highlights resemblance or equivalence between two discourse units.

----Demonstrations----
Arg-1: Success motivates us
Arg-2: but a near win can propel us in an ongoing quest
Answer: The use of “but” highlights a contrast between the effects of success versus a near win. Even though both statements deal with motivation, they emphasize different kinds of outcomes, thereby contrasting two related yet distinct phenomena. The sense is Contrast.
//
Arg-1: That's 133 trillion combined
Arg-2: That's eight and a half times the GDP of the U.S
Answer: Although each argument states a different numerical fact, Arg-2 is used to interpret or frame the magnitude mentioned in Arg-1. They both serve to illustrate the enormity of a quantity, highlighting a similarity or equivalence between the two perspectives. The sense is Similarity.
//
Arg-1: these things are fundamental
Arg-2: but they're not enough
Answer: The second statement introduces a caveat to the first by conceding that, while the things in question are fundamental, they fall short of sufficiency. The “but” marks a cancellation of the expected positive evaluation, making it a concession. The sense is Concession.

----Inference----
Based on these explanations, return the most probable Sense given two components (Arg-1, Arg-2) below.
Just return the output with no commentary. Let's think step by step.

Arg-1: {Arg-1 Text}
Arg-2: {Arg-2 Text}
