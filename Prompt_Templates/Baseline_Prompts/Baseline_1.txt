In the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB), discourse relations are typically defined between two segments
of text called arguments: Arg-1 and Arg-2. Discourse relations are categorized within a hierarchical
sense inventory. These senses provide a detailed classification of discourse relations. We wanted to
determine the sense of our discourse relation.
—-Definitions—-
- Temporal.Synchronous: There is some degree of temporal overlap between the events described by the
arguments.
- Temporal.Asynchronous: One event is described as preceding the other.
- Contingency.Cause: The situations described in the arguments are causally influenced but are not
in a conditional relation.
- Contingency.Cause+Belief: Evidence is provided to cause the hearer to believe a claim.
- Contingency.Purpose: One argument presents an action that an agent undertakes with the purpose of
the goal conveyed by the other argument being achieved.
- Contingency.Condition: One argument presents a situation that must be met for the other argument
to hold.
- Comparison.Concession: An expected causal relation is canceled or denied by the situation described
in one of the arguments.
- Comparison.Contrast: At least two differences between the arguments are highlighted.
- Expansion.Conjunction: Both arguments, which don’t directly relate to each other, bear the same
relation to some other situation evoked in the discourse.
- Expansion.Equivalence: Both arguments are taken to describe the same situation, but from different
perspectives.
- Expansion.Instantiation: One argument describes a situation as holding in a set of circumstances,
while the other argument describes one or more of those circumstances.
- Expansion.Level-of-detail: Both arguments describe the same situation, but in less or more detail.
- Expansion.Substitution: Arguments are presented as exclusive alternatives, with one being ruled
out.
- Expansion.Manner: One argument describes the way in which the situation in the other argument is
carried out.

Based on these explanations, return the most probable sense given two components (Arg-1, Arg-2) below.
Just return the output with no commentary. Let’s think step by step.
Argument 1: {Arg-1 Text}
Argument 2: {Arg-2 Text}
