You are an expert in discourse semantics. We classify any argument span in text according to its abstract object sub-type.
There are four sub-types:
1. Eventuality
- Definition: A situation or event that can be modified in space or time, or that participates in causal chains.
2. Assertion Proposition
- Definition: A declarative statement presented as assertion.
3. Belief Proposition
- Definition: A proposition expressing a mental attitude or disputable content.
4. Fact
- Definition: A true situation or state of affairs, without spatio-temporal modifiers but with potential causal efficacy.
