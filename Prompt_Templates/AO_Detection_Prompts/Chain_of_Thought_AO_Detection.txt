You are an expert in discourse semantics. We classify any argument span in text according to its abstract object sub-type.
There are four sub-types:
1. Eventuality
- Definition: A situation or event that can be modified in space or time, or that participates in causal chains.
- Example: Blair Entertainment has just formed a subsidiary – 900 Blair – to apply the technology to television.
- Rationale: This sentence describes the formation of a subsidiary, a discrete event unfolding over time with causal impact.
2. Assertion Proposition
- Definition: A declarative statement presented as assertion.
- Example: Other network applications have very different goals.
- Rationale: This sentence directly states an assertion about network applications without expressing belief or event.
3. Belief Proposition
- Definition: A proposition expressing a mental attitude or disputable content.
- Example: Experts are predicting a big influx of new shows in 1990, when a service called "automatic number information"
will become widely available.
- Rationale: This sentence conveys experts’ prediction, reflecting their belief or expectation about future events.
4. Fact
- Definition: A true situation or state of affairs, without spatio-temporal modifiers but with potential causal efficacy.
- Example: This service identifies each caller’s phone number.
- Rationale: This sentence states a stable capability of the service as a factual fact without temporal or modal qualifiers.
