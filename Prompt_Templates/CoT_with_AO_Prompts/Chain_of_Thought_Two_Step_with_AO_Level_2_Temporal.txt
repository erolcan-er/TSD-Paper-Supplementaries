----Instruction----
In the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB), discourse relations are typically defined between two segments of text called arguments: Arg-1 and Arg-2.
These arguments can be abstract objects such as Assertion Proposition, Belief Proposition, Eventualities, or Facts.
Discourse relations are categorized within a hierarchical sense inventory.
These senses provide a detailed classification of discourse relations.
We wanted to determine the sense of our discourse relation.

----Definitions----
- Synchronous: There is some degree of temporal overlap between the events described by the arguments.
- Asynchronous: One event is described as preceding the other.

----Demonstrations----
Arg-1: I used magnetic resonance imaging to capture the actual shape of the patient's anatomy
Arg-2: then use finite element modeling to better predict the internal stresses and strains on the normal forces
Answer: Arg-1 conveys an Eventuality. Arg-2 conveys another Eventuality. These arguments are asynchronous. The level-2 sense is Asynchronous.
//
Arg-1: I stood and watched
Arg-2: as the coach drove up these women in this gray van
Answer: Arg-1 conveys an Eventuality. Arg-2 conveys another Eventuality. These arguments are synchronous. The level-2 sense is Synchronous.

----Inference----
Based on these explanations, return the most probable level-2 sense given two components (Arg-1, Arg-2) below.
Just return the output with no commentary. Let's think step by step.

Arg-1: {Arg-1 Text}
Arg-2: {Arg-2 Text}
