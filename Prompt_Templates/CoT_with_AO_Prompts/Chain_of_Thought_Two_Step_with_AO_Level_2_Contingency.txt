----Instruction----
In the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB), discourse relations are typically defined between two segments of text called arguments: Arg-1 and Arg-2.
These arguments can be abstract objects such as Assertion Proposition, Belief Proposition, Eventualities, or Facts.
Discourse relations are categorized within a hierarchical sense inventory.
These senses provide a detailed classification of discourse relations.
We wanted to determine the sense of our discourse relation.

----Definitions----
- Cause: The situations described in the arguments are causally influenced but are not in a conditional relation.
- Cause+Belief: Evidence is provided to cause the hearer to believe a claim.
- Purpose: One argument presents an action that an agent undertakes with the purpose of the goal conveyed by the other argument being achieved.

----Demonstrations----
Arg-1: I like it
Arg-2: because it pokes fun at both sides of the climate change issue
Answer: Arg-1 conveys a Belief Proposition. Arg-2 points conveys an Assertion Proposition. The Arg-2 causes the Arg-1 as a result. The level-2 sense is Cause.
//
Arg-1: it's reckless to ignore these things
Arg-2: doing so can jeopardize future long-term returns
Answer: Arg-1 conveys an Assertion Proposition. Arg-2 conveys another Assertion Proposition. It is believed that the Arg-1 might cause the Arg-2 as a result. The level-2 sense is Cause+Belief.
//
Arg-1: you have to aim at something slightly skew from it
Arg-2: in order that to actually hit your target
Answer: Arg-1 conveys an Assertion Proposition. Arg-2 conveys another Assertion Proposition. Arg-2 is the purpose of Arg-1. The level-2 sense is Purpose.

----Inference----
Based on these explanations, return the most probable level-2 sense given two components (Arg-1, Arg-2) below.
Just return the output with no commentary. Let's think step by step.

Arg-1: {Arg-1 Text}
Arg-2: {Arg-2 Text}
