----Instruction----
In the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB), discourse relations are typically defined between two segments of text called arguments: Arg-1 and Arg-2.
These arguments can be abstract objects such as Assertion Proposition, Belief Proposition, Eventualities, or Facts.
Discourse relations are categorized within a hierarchical sense inventory.
These senses provide a detailed classification of discourse relations.
We wanted to determine the sense of our discourse relation.

----Definitions----
- Comparison: This relation is used when two discourse units are examined in relation to one another. It may highlight similarities (showing equivalence or resemblance), differences (emphasizing contrasts), or even acknowledge that an expected connection (such as a causal link) does not hold (as in concessions).
- Contingency:This relation connects propositions by showing that one situation is dependent on or follows from another. It includes straightforward causeâ€“effect links (where one event brings about another), evidential connections that encourage a belief, and purpose relations where an action is undertaken to achieve a specific goal.
- Expansion: This relation serves to add extra information or elaborate on a situation without implying a direct causal or temporal connection. It might introduce additional details, offer alternative perspectives on the same event (or situation), or specify instances or levels of detail that further flesh out the original idea.
- Temporal: This relation situates events in time. It indicates whether events occur simultaneously (with some temporal overlap) or sequentially (with one event clearly preceding another), thereby establishing the time-based structure of the narrative or discourse.

----Demonstrations----
Arg-1: I used magnetic resonance imaging to capture the actual shape of the patient's anatomy
Arg-2: then use finite element modeling to better predict the internal stresses and strains on the normal forces
Answer: Arg-1 conveys an Eventuality. Arg-2 conveys another Eventuality. These arguments are asynchronous. The level-1 sense is Temporal.
//
Arg-1: I stood and watched
Arg-2: as the coach drove up these women in this gray van
Answer: Arg-1 conveys an Eventuality. Arg-2 conveys another Eventuality. These arguments are synchronous. The level-1 sense is Temporal.
//
Arg-1: I like it
Arg-2: because it pokes fun at both sides of the climate change issue
Answer: Arg-1 conveys a Belief Proposition. Arg-2 points conveys an Assertion Proposition. The Arg-2 causes the Arg-1 as a result. The level-1 sense is Contingency.
//
Arg-1: it's reckless to ignore these things
Arg-2: doing so can jeopardize future long-term returns
Answer: Arg-1 conveys an Assertion Proposition. Arg-2 conveys another Assertion Proposition. It is believed that the Arg-1 might cause the Arg-2 as a result. The level-1 sense is Contingency.
//
Arg-1: you have to aim at something slightly skew from it
Arg-2: in order that to actually hit your target
Answer: Arg-1 conveys an Assertion Proposition. Arg-2 conveys another Assertion Proposition. Arg-2 is the purpose of Arg-1. The level-1 sense is Contingency.
//
Arg-1: Success motivates us
Arg-2: but a near win can propel us in an ongoing quest
Answer: Arg-1 conveys an Assertion Proposition. Arg-2 conveys another Assertion Proposition. These arguments are contrastive. The level-1 sense is Comparison.
//
Arg-1: That's 133 trillion combined
Arg-2: That's eight and a half times the GDP of the U.S
Answer: Arg-1 conveys a Fact. Arg-2 conveys another Fact. Arg-1 is the another way of explaining the Arg-2. The level-1 sense is Comparison.
//
Arg-1: these things are fundamental
Arg-2: but they're not enough
Answer: Arg-1 conveys an Assertion Proposition. Arg-2 conveys another Assertion Proposition. Arg-2 does not fulfill the expectation given in Arg-1. The level-1 sense is Comparison.
//
Arg-1: They're economic issues
Arg-2: and that makes them relevant to risk and return
Answer: Arg-1 conveys an Assertion Proposition. Arg-2 conveys another Assertion Proposition. These Assertion Propositions occur in conjunction with each other. The level-1 sense is Expansion.
//
Arg-1: Many cities are investing in green infrastructure to combat climate change
Arg-2: New York City has implemented a large-scale tree-planting initiative to reduce urban heat and improve air quality
Answer: Arg-1 conveys an Eventuality. Arg-2 conveys another Eventuality. Arg-2 gives an example for the Arg-1. The level-1 sense is Expansion.
//
Arg-1: Let me remind you what we already know
Arg-2: We have a population that's both growing and aging
Answer: Arg-1 conveys an Assertion Proposition. Arg-2 conveys a Fact. Arg-2 is giving details about the Arg-1. The level-1 sense is Expansion.
//
Arg-1: prudent investing and finance theory aren't subordinate to sustainability
Arg-2: They're compatible
Answer: Arg-1 conveys an Assertion Proposition. Arg-2 conveys another Assertion Proposition. Arg-2 is a substitution of the proposition defined in Arg-1. The level-1 sense is Expansion.
//
Arg-1: That's the world's largest economy
Arg-2: That's some serious freaking firepower
Answer: Arg-1 conveys a Fact. Arg-2 conveys an Assertion Proposition. Arg-2 describes the same proposition defined in Arg-1. The level-1 sense is Expansion.

----Inference----
Based on these explanations, return the most probable level-1 sense given two components (Arg-1, Arg-2) below.
Just return the output with no commentary. Let's think step by step.
