----Instruction----
In the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB), discourse relations are typically defined between two segments of text called arguments: Arg-1 and Arg-2.
These arguments can be abstract objects such as Assertion Proposition, Belief Proposition, Eventualities, or Facts.
Discourse relations are categorized within a hierarchical sense inventory.
These senses provide a detailed classification of discourse relations.
We wanted to determine the sense of our discourse relation.

----Definitions----
- Conjunction: Both arguments, which donâ€™t directly relate to each other, bear the same relation to some other situation evoked in the discourse.
- Equivalence: Both arguments are taken to describe the same situation, but from different perspectives.
- Instantiation: One argument describes a situation as holding in a set of circumstances, while the other argument describes one or more of those circumstances.
- Level-of-detail: Both arguments describe the same situation, but in less or more detail.
- Substitution: Arguments are presented as exclusive alternatives, with one being ruled out.

----Demonstrations----
Arg-1: They're economic issues
Arg-2: and that makes them relevant to risk and return
Answer: Arg-1 conveys an Assertion Proposition. Arg-2 conveys another Assertion Proposition. These Assertion Propositions occur in conjunction with each other. The level-2 sense is Conjunction.
//
Arg-1: Many cities are investing in green infrastructure to combat climate change
Arg-2: New York City has implemented a large-scale tree-planting initiative to reduce urban heat and improve air quality
Answer: Arg-1 conveys an Eventuality. Arg-2 conveys another Eventuality. Arg-2 gives an example for the Arg-1. The level-2 sense is Instantiation.
//
Arg-1: Let me remind you what we already know
Arg-2: We have a population that's both growing and aging
Answer: Arg-1 conveys an Assertion Proposition. Arg-2 conveys a Fact. Arg-2 is giving details about the Arg-1. The level-2 sense is Level-of-detail.
//
Arg-1: prudent investing and finance theory aren't subordinate to sustainability
Arg-2: They're compatible
Answer: Arg-1 conveys an Assertion Proposition. Arg-2 conveys another Assertion Proposition. Arg-2 is a substitution of the proposition defined in Arg-1. The level-2 sense is Substitution.
//
Arg-1: That's the world's largest economy
Arg-2: That's some serious freaking firepower
Answer: Arg-1 conveys a Fact. Arg-2 conveys an Assertion Proposition. Arg-2 describes the same proposition defined in Arg-1. The level-2 sense is Equivalence.

----Inference----
Based on these explanations, return the most probable level-2 sense given two components (Arg-1, Arg-2) below.
Just return the output with no commentary. Let's think step by step.

Arg-1: {Arg-1 Text}
Arg-2: {Arg-2 Text}
