----Instruction----
In the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB), discourse relations are typically defined between two segments of text called arguments: Arg-1 and Arg-2.
These arguments can be abstract objects such as Assertion Proposition, Belief Proposition, Eventualities, or Facts.
Discourse relations are categorized within a hierarchical sense inventory.
These senses provide a detailed classification of discourse relations.
We wanted to determine the sense of our discourse relation.

----Definitions----
- Concession: An expected causal relation is canceled or denied by the situation described in one of the arguments.
- Contrast: At least two differences between the arguments are highlighted.
- Similarity: Highlights resemblance or equivalence between two discourse units.

----Demonstrations----
Arg-1: Success motivates us
Arg-2: but a near win can propel us in an ongoing quest
Answer: Arg-1 conveys an Assertion Proposition. Arg-2 conveys another Assertion Proposition. These arguments are contrastive. The level-2 sense is Contrast.
//
Arg-1: That's 133 trillion combined
Arg-2: That's eight and a half times the GDP of the U.S
Answer: Arg-1 conveys a Fact. Arg-2 conveys another Fact. Arg-1 is the another way of explaining the Arg-2. The level-2 sense is Similarity.
//
Arg-1: these things are fundamental
Arg-2: but they're not enough
Answer: Arg-1 conveys an Assertion Proposition. Arg-2 conveys another Assertion Proposition. Arg-2 does not fulfill the expectation given in Arg-1. The level-2 sense is Concession.

----Inference----
Based on these explanations, return the most probable level-2 sense given two components (Arg-1, Arg-2) below.
Just return the output with no commentary. Let's think step by step.

Arg-1: {Arg-1 Text}
Arg-2: {Arg-2 Text}
